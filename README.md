# PIC C Programming & Proteus Simulations

This repository contains example programs and projects for **PIC microcontrollers** written in **C**, along with **Proteus simulation files**.  
It is designed to help beginners and embedded engineers learn, practice, and test PIC programming.

## ðŸ“Œ Contents
- Basic C programs (LED blink, timers, ADC, UART, IÂ²C, SPI)
- Peripheral interfacing (sensors, LCD, motors, etc.)
- Mini projects with explanations
- Proteus simulation files for testing and visualization
